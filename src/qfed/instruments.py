    A. Darmenov - Segmented polynomial regression model 
    fitted to VIIRS 375m pixel dimensions data. VIIRS 
    data was provided by Wilfrid Schroeder (NOAA; personal 
    communication).
 
    Note that in the tabular data:
        sample = 0     at nadir
        sample = 3199  at the edge (either left or right)
    whereas in the VIIRS granules/images the samples are 
    in the interval [0, 6399].

    The tabular data has two points of discontinuity:
        breakpoint = (1184, 1920)    
    hence there are three intervals:   
        interval = ((0, 1184), (1184, 1920), (1920, 3199))
    
    Pixel area data in each interval was fitted to a polynomial
    of degree 5. The coefficients of the three polynomials, 
    in decreasing powers, are included in the code.
