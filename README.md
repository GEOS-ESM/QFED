# QFED

The Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED) uses satellite-retrieved fire radiative power (FRP) to estimate fire emissions globally. The principal QFED product (Level 3A) contains gridded FRP stratified by biome. The Level 3B product provides gridded biomass burning emissions for a number of pyrogenic species. 

Two QFED product systems are maintained by the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO):
- Near real-time daily emissions used operationally in the GEOS Forward Processing (FP) system and in the GEOS Composition Forecasting (CF) system.
- An extended historical dataset of daily emissions from March 2000 to present.
